<p>Hello, this is a small project to understand the truffle framework, it is powerful since it is a set of programming tools oriented to smart contracts (smart contracts) to develop sustainable and professional applications on the blockchain using the Ethereum Virtual Machine ( EVM), as well as carry out the different tests in a developer-friendly integrated development environment.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the environment that allows developers to create smart contracts and applications that the blockchain can understand.</p>
<p>I hope you like this little example.</p>  
<p>Feel free to write me if you have any questions, or if you just want advice on where to start.</p>

<h2> Installing / Getting started </h2>

```bash

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

```

<p>Drop all necessary dependencies</p>
<hr>

<h2>Commands</h2>

- $ `truffle compile `: Upon first run, all contracts will be compiled. Upon subsequent runs, Truffle will compile only the contracts that have been changed since the last compile.
- $ `truffle migrate `: This will run all migrations located within our project's migrations directory.
- $ `truffle test `: Run all tests located within our project's test directory.

<h2> Technologies / Built With </h2>

- Solidity
- Metamask
- Fake ETH (ðŸš¨ Note: <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/"> Goerli Faucet</a>)
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/contracts"> OpenZeppelin </a>
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache?activeTab=readme"> Ganache CLI </a>
- <a href="https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/"> Ganache GUI </a>

<h2>Prettier definition </h2>
<p> Prettier offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What <Prettier> offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.</p>
